The term `reproducible research <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility>`__ refers to the idea 
that the ultimate product of academic research is the paper along with the full computational environment used to produce the results in the paper 
such as the code, data, etc., that can be used to reproduce the results and create new work based on the research.

   
  *"An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, 
  it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures."    ------ David Donoho*

Diffusion MRI Tool
===================

DMRITool_ is an open source toolbox for diffusion MRI data processing. 
It is written in C++ with matlab mex interface. 
The source code is in `github <https://github.com/DiffusionMRITool/dmritool>`__. 
Most of the methods I proposed for diffusion MRI have been or will be released in DMRITool_. 
DMRITool_ has implemented:

* `Diffusion MRI data simulation <https://diffusionmritool.github.io/tutorial_dwisimulation.html>`__
* `Diffusion MRI data visualization <https://diffusionmritool.github.io/commands/commandlist.html#visualization>`__
* `Spherical Polar Fourier Imaging <https://diffusionmritool.github.io/tutorial_spfi.html>`__
* `Spherically Uniform Sampling scheme design in q-space <https://diffusionmritool.github.io/tutorial_qspacesampling.html>`__




Brain Age Estimation 
====================

`TSAN-brain-age-estimation <https://github.com/Milan-BUAA/TSAN-brain-age-estimation>`__: 
Pytorch codes for the paper 
"`Brain Age Estimation From MRI Using Cascade Networks with Ranking Loss <https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2021.3085948>`__", 
IEEE transactions on Medical Imaging, 2021. 


LRTV for Image Superresolution
==============================

`LRTV <https://github.com/JianCheng/superresolutiontoolkit>`__: a Matlab toolbox implemented Low-Rank Total Variation for image super-resolution proposed in the paper 
"`LRTV: MR Image Super-Resolution with Low-Rank and Total Variation Regularizations <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278037176_LRTV_MR_Image_Super-Resolution_with_Low-Rank_and_Total_Variation_Regularizations>`__", 
IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2015. 


bibtex2html.py
==============

`bibtex2html.py <https://github.com/JianCheng/bibtex2html.py>`__: a python toolbox to covert a bibtex file into an html file. 
It considers additional fields (e.g., note, code, etc.) in bibtex. 
It also can show corresponding google scholar citations related with bibtex entries by parsing the google scholar profile.
See `my publications <publications_by_type.html>`__ as an example.
